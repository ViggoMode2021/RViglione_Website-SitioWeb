# RViglione_Website-SitioWeb
This repository consists of my Flask project for my website. It contains the main Python/Flask file, as well as HTML templates, CSS sheets, and static files for the different pages. I will be updating this frequently. 

The file is originally hosted using PythonAnywhere.com, but the domain I purchased is from IONOS. The CNAME file points IONOS to the domain, which is RyanViglione.net

As of Thursday, October 27th, 2021 at 4:30 P.M., the DNS has started propogating. The hope is that in 24 to 48 hours, the website will be live on RyanViglione.net.

This website will be updated frequently for the dual purpose of general updates, as well as a passion project to help further my knowledge of Python/Flask, HTML, CSS, and general programming.

Thank you/Gracias.
